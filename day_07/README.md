### DAY 7

##Key Concepts
*Arrays
*Array functions
  
##Homework:
Now that you know how to declare, create, and assign an array, think of a list of subjects (i.e. students in your bootcamp section)  to present visually in a sketch.  Think of ways to expand upon this list to make the sketch more interesting with different colors and shapes (i.e. lines, circles, squares).
