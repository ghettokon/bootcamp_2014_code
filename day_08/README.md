## Summer 2014 Bootcamp Code Syllabus

### DAY 8

##Key Concepts
* Physics (collisions, gravity, speed)
* Arrays (continued)
  
##Homework:
Think about different examples of physics (speed and acceleration) in nature. Wind? Springs? Friction? Can you simulate any of them? **Extra credit** Use an array of elements and make it interact with the mouse.

##References:
* Take a look at the work of [Mike Tucker](http://gamemechanicexplorer.com/) for simple physics simulations
* For physics applied to game mechanics, check out [Game Mechanic Explorer](http://gamemechanicexplorer.com/)
* The two other examples in this folder ("collision" and "repel") show different applications of the same physics concepts from today. Explore them and check how they work.
